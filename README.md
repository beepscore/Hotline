By adopting CallKit, your app will be able to:

Use the native incoming call screen in both the locked and unlocked states.
Start calls from the native Phone appâ€™s Contacts, Favorites and Recents screens.
Interplay with other calls in the system.

## CXProvider
App sends CXCallUpdate to notify system about changes to a call.

## CXCallController
Makes requests to the system on behalf of the user.
Call controller uses CXTransaction containing one or more CXAction.

## CXAction
System sends a concrete instance of CXAction abstract class (e.g. CXStartCallAction) to CXProvider to notifiy app of events.
